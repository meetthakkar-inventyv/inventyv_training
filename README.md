## Modules Overview

### 01_LOGIC_BUILDING
Focuses on developing logical thinking and problem-solving skills through structured approaches and flowcharts.

---

### 02_HTML_CSS_LOGINPAGE
A responsive login and registration page created using pure HTML and CSS, emphasizing layout design and UI fundamentals.

---

### 03_DBMS
Hands-on MySQL assignment involving multiple SQL queries on a movie database, covering essential DBMS concepts.

---

### 04_JavaScript_Task
JavaScript practice tasks focusing on array manipulation, function flow, Promises, and working with Symbols to strengthen core JavaScript fundamentals.

---

### 05_Exercism_Javascript

Completed the Exercism JavaScript module, solving various challenges to master language syntax, built-in methods, and logical implementation.


---

### 06_Rust

Rust programming assignments focused on understanding core language concepts, memory safety, concurrency, serialization, and modular application design using Cargo.

- **1_control_flow**  
  Covers basic Rust control flow constructs such as loops, conditionals, and execution logic.

- **2_structs_and_methods**  
  Demonstrates struct creation, method implementations, setters/getters, and ownership of data.

- **3_serde_json**  
  Explores JSON serialization and deserialization using `serde` and `serde_json`.

- **4_ownership_and_borrowing**  
  Performs task to understand `ownership` and `borrwing` with `mutable references`.

- **5_Request_Tracking_Assignment**  
  Implements request counters using concurrency primitives like `Mutex`, `RwLock`, and atomics.

- **6_Modules_Assignment**  
  Focuses on Rust’s module system, organizing code into reusable modules and integrating them through a single entry point.

- **7_HashMap_HashSet_Assignment**  
  Demonstrates usage of `HashMap` and `HashSet`, including ownership transfer, cloning, and collection manipulation methods.

- **8_Inventory_Management**
  Implements a generic inventory system using traits and generics.
  Focuses on `HashMap`-based storage, trait bounds, cloning, and custom error handling with `Enum`.

- **9_Inventory_Lifetimes_and_Closures**
Extends the inventory system by storing borrowed data using lifetimes.
Focuses on lifetime annotations, reference-based storage, closures for displaying inventory data, and safe memory management without ownership.
